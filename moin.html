    This Nigerian dish is also called moi moi or moyi moyi. Moin moin is a savory steamed bean pudding thatâ€™s made from a mixture of black-eyed peas, habanero peppers, bell peppers, palm oil, and onions.

You make moin moin by soaking the peas, processing them to remove the skins, seasoning them, and steaming the paste. You can form moin moin either by hand or in a ramekin for easier cleanup.
