<h5>  How to Make Ewedu Soup:</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Pick your Ewedu leaves, make sure you don’t pick the stalk/stem along with it.</li>
    <li>Wash the leaves thoroughly to rid it of dirt. Pour the water into a medium size pan, place on a bob on medium heat, bring to a rolling boil.</li>
    <li>If you’re using a broom (Ijabe), use the broom to pound the leaves.</li>
    <li>If you’re using a blender, take the Ewedu off the heat and leave to cool for a bit…don’t switch the heat off.</li>
    <li>Add the Ewedu into a blender along with the Iru, make sure you don’t add all the water, just 1/2 a cup should do. Too much water will affect the viscosity of your Ewedu.</li>
    <li>Using the pulse function, pulse a few times till you get a semi-purée consistency.</li>
    <li>Transfer the Ewedu back into the pan, add the ground crayfish, bouillon cube and salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Switch off the heat and let it simmer with the residual heat for 3 minutes….stir occasionally to prevent burning. Do not over cook or the Ewedu will go brown.</li>
