  <p>  This Nigerian dish is also called moi moi or moyi moyi. Moin moin is a savory steamed bean pudding that’s made from a mixture of black-eyed peas, habanero peppers, bell peppers, palm oil, and onions.</p>
<p>You make moin moin by soaking the peas, processing them to remove the skins, seasoning them, and steaming the paste. You can form moin moin either by hand or in a ramekin for easier cleanup.

<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
<li>Black-eyed Peas or Honey Beans – Best to use black-eyed peas or honey beans (Ewa oloyin)</li>
<li></li>

Peppers – It’s best to use a combination of peppers like red bell peppers (tatashe) and scotch bonnet(rodo) for a deeper flavor profile.
Onion – Onions, as always, bring out the flavor in the food.
Crayfish – you can ground the dry crayfish with the beans or use powdered crayfish.
Vegetable Oil/Palm oil – You can use palm oil, vegetable oil, or a mixture. 
Chicken bouillon Cubes – Add this for taste.
Fish – This is optional but a great addition. The fish is boiled and cut into chunks. I like to use Mackerel or Salmon.
Hard-boiled Eggs – Also a great addition!
Boiled beef liver – This is also optional. It will make a great filing in the mix. I love it because beef liver is nutrient-dense. 
Salt – Add salt to taste
