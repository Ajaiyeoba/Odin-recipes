  <p>  This Nigerian dish is also called moi moi or moyi moyi. Moin moin is a savory steamed bean pudding that’s made from a mixture of black-eyed peas, habanero peppers, bell peppers, palm oil, and onions.</p>
<p>You make moin moin by soaking the peas, processing them to remove the skins, seasoning them, and steaming the paste. You can form moin moin either by hand or in a ramekin for easier cleanup.

<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
<li>Black-eyed Peas or Honey Beans – Best to use black-eyed peas or honey beans (Ewa oloyin)</li>
<li></li>

Peppers – It’s best to use a combination of peppers like red bell peppers (tatashe) and scotch bonnet(rodo) for a deeper flavor profile.
Onion – Onions, as always, bring out the flavor in the food.
Crayfish – you can ground the dry crayfish with the beans or use powdered crayfish.
Vegetable Oil/Palm oil – You can use palm oil, vegetable oil, or a mixture. 
Chicken bouillon Cubes – Add this for taste.
Fish – This is optional but a great addition. The fish is boiled and cut into chunks. I like to use Mackerel or Salmon.
Hard-boiled Eggs – Also a great addition!
Boiled beef liver – This is also optional. It will make a great filing in the mix. I love it because beef liver is nutrient-dense. 
Salt – Add salt to taste
</ul>


How to make Moi Moi
Soak the beans. It would be best to soak your beans for about 10 to 20 minutes. Dryer beans tend to be ready faster, while less dry beans will take a little longer.
Peel your beans. You can peel your beans manually by rubbing them together between your palms. That is a long process, so I have found a shortcut for peeling. I use a food processor. This is a fast way to peel your beans.
Sieve the skin of the beans out. After peeling, wash your beans and sieve out the skin until you get clean beans. The skin would float itself while the seed would go down. You can soak the beans for 10 minutes more to make them softer.
Blend the beans and other ingredients – Add the beans into the blender with pepper and onions. Add bouillon cubes, salt, and crayfish. Add a cup of water to blend.
Turn the batter into a bowl. Inside the batter, add the groundnut oil and mix.
Add fish chunks or liver. You can add boiled fish already cut into chunks or pour in liver cut into small pieces. Keep mixing.
Prepare the bowls – Depending on what you want to use for your Moi Moi, wash it and oil the plates. I used Ramekins Bakeware for this recipe.
Portion the batter to the bowls. 
Add the boiled egg on top. Add your boiled egg on top. You don’t have to push it deep into the mix.
Put the pot on the stove and add boiled water.
Arrange the Moi Moi in the pot and cover. Allow it to steam for like 45 minutes. If you notice that the water in the pot has dried up, carefully add more water.
Carefully remove the Moi Moi from the plate and enjoy.
